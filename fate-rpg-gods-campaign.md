Can you create 3 gods using the Fate rpg rules, use the following format for characters:

**[Character Name]**

**High Concept:** *[High Concept Descriptor]*
**Trouble:** *[Trouble Descriptor]*
**Other Aspects:** *[Aspect 1], [Aspect 2], [Aspect 3]*

**Skills:**

- Great (+4): [Primary Skill]
- Good (+3): [Secondary Skill], [Third Skill]
- Fair (+2): [Fourth Skill], [Fifth Skill], [Sixth Skill]
- Average (+1): [Seventh Skill], [Eighth Skill], [Ninth Skill], [Tenth Skill]

- [Stunt 2]: [Stunt 2 Description]
- [Stunt 3]: [Stunt 3 Description]
  
**Stress:** Physical [Physical Stress Number], Mental [Mental Stress Number]

**Refresh:** [Refresh Number]

Play out an extended campaign with these characters.

Try to use all aspects of the Fate system including Campaign creation, Aspects (Scene, Scenario, Campaign, Character), Skills, Fate Points, Actions (Attack, Defend, Overcome, Create an Advantage), Stress Tracks (Physical, Mental), Consequences, Stunts, Refresh, Zones, Extras, Boosts, Invokes, Challenges, Contests, Conflicts, NPC Creation, Fate Dice, The Fate Ladder and in particular Compels. 

Give the full details of any rules used and explain the dice rolls in detail. 

Use bold text for titles and italics for the names of aspects. 

Write in an imaginative and exciting style similar to Ursula K. Le Guin. 

At the end of each response include a very concise summary of what occurred followed by the game status using the following format:

[aspects in play as a comma separated list, if the aspect has a boost use a ‚òê to indicate this]  
- **[Character name]**: [fate]/[physical stress]/[mental stress] *[consequences if present]*
- **[Character name]**: [fate]/[physical stress]/[mental stress] *[consequences if present]*
